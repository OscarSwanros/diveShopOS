# Design Philosophy

## Core Principle

DiveShopOS is **professional operations software for dive businesses**. Every design decision must serve operational efficiency, diver safety, and professional quality.

## Design Values

### 1. Safety First
Safety-critical information (certification status, medical clearance, equipment service status) takes visual priority. Use color, typography weight, and position to ensure safety data is never missed.

### 2. Operational Efficiency
The primary users are dive shop staff during busy operations. Design for:
- Quick scanning (manifests, schedules, check-in queues)
- Minimal clicks for common tasks
- Efficient data entry (keyboard shortcuts, smart defaults)
- Information density without clutter

### 3. Professional Quality
The interface should feel like reliable business software:
- Clean, not flashy
- Consistent, not surprising
- Informative, not decorative
- Trustworthy, not trendy

### 4. Accessibility as Foundation
Accessible design is good design. It's not a checkbox -- it's the foundation:
- Works for all staff regardless of ability
- Usable in challenging conditions (bright sun, busy environment)
- Doesn't rely on color alone for meaning
- Keyboard navigable throughout

### 5. Agency Neutrality
DiveShopOS works with all certification agencies. The design never favors one agency's branding, terminology, or visual identity over another. This neutrality is both a product principle and a design constraint.

## Target Users

1. **Shop owners/managers**: Need dashboards, reports, business overview
2. **Front desk staff**: Need quick check-in, booking, waiver workflows
3. **Instructors**: Need course schedules, student progress, certification tracking
4. **Boat captains/divemasters**: Need manifests, dive site info, head counts

## Operational Contexts

Design must work well in these environments:
- **Front desk**: Desktop/laptop, may be interrupted, phone ringing
- **Boat/poolside**: Tablet in bright sun, potentially wet conditions
- **Classroom**: Desktop, student-facing during enrollment
- **Office**: Desktop, data-heavy reporting and planning

## Anti-Patterns

- Decorative elements that don't serve operations
- Trendy UI patterns that sacrifice clarity
- Consumer-app aesthetics (gamification, social features)
- Visual complexity without informational value
- Animations that slow down workflows
