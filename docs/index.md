description: Professional dive shop management software. Scheduling, courses, customers, equipment, and safety compliance -- one platform built by divers, for dive businesses.

# Run your dive operation, not your software.

**DiveShopOS is the all-in-one management platform built for dive shops and schools.** Schedule excursions, manage courses, track equipment, handle bookings, and enforce safety compliance -- from a single system that works the way your shop does.

## Safety gates that protect your operation

Other management tools let you make mistakes. DiveShopOS prevents them.

Built-in safety gates enforce the rules your operation depends on. The system will not assign an Open Water diver to an advanced wreck trip. It will not rent out a regulator overdue for service. It will not exceed boat capacity or bypass medical clearance requirements.

Every gate is auditable. Every override requires authorization and a documented reason. Your operation stays safe, and your records prove it.

## Works with every certification agency

PADI, SSI, NAUI, SDI/TDI, RAID, CMAS, BSAC -- DiveShopOS is agency neutral by design. Track certifications, instructor ratings, and course requirements across any agency your staff and customers train with.

No favoritism. No lock-in. Just clean data for your entire operation, regardless of who issued the card.

## Your brand, your domain

Your divers visit **yourdiveshop.com** -- not a subdirectory on someone else's platform. DiveShopOS supports custom domains and whitelabel branding so your online presence stays yours.

Your logo. Your colors. Your domain. The software stays in the background where it belongs.

## Built for the desk, the dock, and the boat

DiveShopOS is a modern web application. No native app to install or update. Fast, responsive, and built to handle the environments where dive shops actually operate -- front desk check-ins, dockside manifests, and classroom enrollments.

Real-time updates keep your team in sync. Turbo-powered interfaces mean fewer page loads and faster workflows during the busiest days of the season.

## One platform for your entire operation

- **Excursions** -- Schedule trips, manage manifests, assign staff
- **Courses** -- Catalog offerings, track enrollments, record progress
- **Customers** -- Diver profiles, certifications, medical records, waivers
- **Equipment** -- Rental fleet, service tracking, retail inventory
- **Bookings** -- Reservations, deposits, payments, cancellations
- **Staff** -- Instructor ratings, availability, assignments

Stop stitching together spreadsheets, paper manifests, and disconnected tools. Run it all from one place.

## Coming Soon

DiveShopOS is in active development. We are building this for dive professionals who need real operations software -- not another booking widget.
