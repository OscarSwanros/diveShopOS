    <h2>Safety gates that protect your operation</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">Generic booking tools let you make mistakes. DiveShopOS prevents them.</p>
    <p>Seven built-in safety gates enforce the rules your operation depends on -- automatically, every time. Not as warnings you can click past. As hard stops that require authorized overrides with documented reasons.</p>

    <div class="safety-gates">
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Certification Gate</h3>
        <p>An Open Water diver cannot be added to an advanced wreck excursion. The system checks certification levels against activity requirements before a participant is ever confirmed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Medical Fitness Gate</h3>
        <p>Expired or uncleared medical records block a diver from any water activity. No exceptions without an authorized override.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Equipment Service Gate</h3>
        <p>Life-support gear overdue for service is blocked from rental. Regulators, BCDs, and cylinders are tracked with service intervals that cannot be silently ignored.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Instructor Rating Gate</h3>
        <p>An instructor cannot be assigned to a course or excursion without an active rating for that activity and agency. Expired ratings are caught before scheduling, not after.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Capacity Gate</h3>
        <p>Boat capacity and instructor-to-student ratios are hard limits. The manifest cannot exceed what the vessel or the staffing can safely handle.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-gate">
        <h3>Age Gate</h3>
        <p>Minimum age requirements are enforced per course type and certification agency. A 9-year-old cannot be enrolled in a Junior Open Water program that requires age 10.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="safety-summary">Every gate decision is logged. Every override is auditable. Your operation stays safe, and your records prove it.</p>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Excursions</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <p>Full course catalog with scheduled offerings, class sessions, and enrollment. Safety gates validate every enrollment. Attendance tracking and course completion automatically issue certifications.</p>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>Track your rental fleet with serial numbers, service records, and overdue alerts. Life-support gear gets the attention it demands -- service intervals are enforced, not suggested.</p>
