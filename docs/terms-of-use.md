# Terms of Use

**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Customer," "you," or "your") and DiveShopOS ("DiveShopOS," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the DiveShopOS platform, including all associated services, features, and documentation (collectively, the "Service").

By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a dive shop, school, or other business entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity.

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Service Description

DiveShopOS is a cloud-based, multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform designed for professional dive shop and dive school operations. The Service provides tools for:

- **Excursion scheduling and manifest management** -- plan dive trips, assign participants, and manage boat manifests.
- **Course management** -- maintain a course catalog, manage enrollments, and track student progress toward certification.
- **Customer and diver profiles** -- store diver information, including certification records, medical clearance status, and emergency contacts.
- **Certification tracking** -- record and monitor diver certifications across all recognized certification agencies.
- **Medical clearance management** -- track medical fitness records and clearance status for water activities.
- **Equipment management** -- manage rental fleets, track equipment service histories, and monitor life-support gear maintenance schedules.
- **Booking and payments** -- process reservations, deposits, and payments for excursions, courses, and equipment rentals.
- **Safety compliance tools** -- automated checks for certification levels, medical clearance, waiver status, equipment service status, capacity limits, and instructor-to-student ratios.

Each Customer account operates as an independent Organization within the platform. All data is isolated at the Organization level; no Organization can access another Organization's data.

## 2. Diving Safety Disclaimer

**THIS SECTION IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. READ IT CAREFULLY.**

DiveShopOS provides software tools designed to assist dive professionals in managing safety-related information. These tools include certification-level checks, medical clearance tracking, equipment service status monitoring, waiver management, capacity enforcement, and instructor ratio calculations.

**However, DiveShopOS is a management tool -- not a safety system, not a dive computer, and not a substitute for professional judgment.**

**The dive professional is always the final authority on safety decisions.** No software system can evaluate water conditions in real time, assess a diver's physical readiness on a given day, judge weather changes, or make the dozens of situational decisions that qualified instructors, divemasters, and boat captains make before and during every dive.

Specifically:

- **DiveShopOS does not guarantee diver safety.** The Service assists with record-keeping and compliance tracking, but the responsibility for safe diving operations rests entirely with the qualified dive professionals conducting those operations.
- **Software checks are advisory, not authoritative.** When DiveShopOS flags a certification mismatch, an expired medical clearance, or an overdue equipment service, these are informational alerts based on the data entered into the system. They do not replace a professional's on-site assessment.
- **Data accuracy depends on human input.** The safety-related checks performed by the Service are only as reliable as the data entered by your staff. Incorrect, outdated, or incomplete data will produce incorrect results.
- **Override capability exists by design.** Authorized staff may override safety gates when professional judgment warrants it. Every override is logged for audit purposes. The decision to override -- and the responsibility for that decision -- belongs to the dive professional, not to the software.
- **No software replaces training, experience, or situational awareness.** DiveShopOS is built by people who understand diving. We know that a green light on a screen is not the same as an experienced instructor's assessment. Use the Service as one input among many -- never as the sole basis for a safety decision.

**By using DiveShopOS, you acknowledge and agree that all diving safety decisions are the sole responsibility of your qualified dive professionals, and that DiveShopOS bears no liability for diving accidents, injuries, or fatalities arising from your operations, regardless of whether the Service's safety tools were used, not used, or overridden.**

## 5. Certification Agency Neutrality

DiveShopOS is designed to work with all recognized scuba diving certification agencies, including but not limited to PADI, SSI, NAUI, SDI/TDI, RAID, CMAS, BSAC, and GUE. The Service does not endorse, favor, or discriminate against any particular certification agency.

You may use the Service to track certifications issued by any recognized agency. The platform uses agency-neutral terminology where possible and supports recording agency-specific certification titles and levels as entered by your staff.
